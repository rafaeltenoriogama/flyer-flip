# Índices Ambiental Transportes Urbanos
This project presents various environmental indices for urban transportation. 
The indices are displayed in a "column" style, similar to Instagram, allowing employees to scroll through the images vertically. Each image is placed within a container that provides spacing and shadow effects to enhance visibility and aesthetics.
